      <p class="lead">The roclin group is a <strong>CODE</strong> partnership: a <strong>C</strong>entrally <strong>O</strong>rganized group of <strong>D</strong>ecentralized <strong>E</strong>ntities.</p>
      <p>Life is a balancing act, our business model and programming design principles to bring access and control between individuals and groups.</p> 
      <p>This approach facilitates trust and respect to build a relationship to data for an IoT revolution with access to a basic income for users, communities and participating businesses.</p>
      <p>What does this mean in real terms? CODE defines a flexible social contract for an adaptive social contract between individuals and collaborating teams.</p>
      <p>Our developers aspire to bring community-based solutions to scale beyond the hype of decentralized technology, cut down noisy fake news with <strong>context</strong>, democratize search and shape human-oriented advertising instead of clicks.</p>
      <p>This structure will enable our platform to implement the New Deal on Data as described by Alex Pentland of the Human Dynamics MIT Media Lab.</p>

      <div class="well">
        <p>Revolutionizing how data</p>
        <ul class="caption-li">
          <li>is visualized, enabling us to find reliable information</li>
          <li>is moved, connecting individuals directly; breaking down information silos</li>
          <li>is controlled, accessed and monetized</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>We believe in not only privacy, but respect. This means keeping the technical simple, with modular design to connecting people through ideas and an end to information silos.</p>
      <p>In business terms this means there's lower overhead, intermediary oversight, and room for participation by community leaders to partner with us to bring CODE computing to your businesses, communities and organizations as early adopters.</p>

      <div class="well">
        <p>We are looking for the outcasts, the autodidact, iconoclast who wants to be a part of change to build a better world. Our mission is to apply technology with human oriented design to connect people, and that takes diverse perspectives to achieve.</p>
        <p>We are enthused to meet any developers, interns, crypto-experts, data scientists, designers, web developers and blockchain engineers with skill sets that cross between.</p>
        <p>Partners who would like to get involved in creating social action, creating content for multiple perspectives through whatever medium, curating content, comparing philosophies or connecting business. We’d like to keep in touch.</p>
        <p>Reach out, spread the word, ask questions and connect your network to ours.</p>
